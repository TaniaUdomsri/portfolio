           <p class="mdc-typography--body1">How’s my driving? 2.0 is a new channel for <strong>Amazon sellers to provide their feedback on Amazon Seller Central</strong>. Amazon Seller Central is a web interface used by merchants or third-party sellers to sell their products directly to Amazon’s customers. How’s my driving? 2.0 is a reusable web component that can be easily embedded on any pages on Seller Central website with just five lines of code. Each page has a unique attribute to query for the results from their pages.</p>

            <li><li-head>Low volume and bad quality of feedback</li-head>
            The previous version of How’s my driving? suffered from some key limitations, especially the low volume of feedback and quality of feedback. These can lead to a feedback signal that may be too weak to make an informed decision.</li>
            <li><li-head>Collaboration</li-head>
            Another challenge was the ownership and collaboration with a different organization. My team works on Seller Central, but we do not own the “How’s my driving?” tool. So communication is the essential key to get all team member at the same page.</li>
            <li><li-head>Limited development resources</li-head>
            Limited development resources was also a challenge. Because we do not own the tool, we did not have an assigned development resource for us.</li>

          <ol class="mdc-typography--body1">
            <li><li-head>Increase the quantity and quality of feedback</li-head>
            To increase the quantity and quality of seller feedback, I redesign a <strong>simpler, more intuitive UI, and a more predominant location</strong> on the page. We simplified the rating score from a 10-scale to a 5-scale system and added animation and icons to the scores. For the discoverability, we created a sticky label at the bottom of the page and ran an <strong>A/B</strong> testing to determine the winning location.</li>
            <li><li-head>Reusable web component</li-head>
            We needed to convince the owner of this tool to collaborate with our team and to implement the new design across Seller Central. However, they did not have a resource for us at that point. Our solution is to create a <strong>reusable web component</strong> that can be easily embedded on any pages. We started by launching the new “How’s my driving?” components on three pages on Seller Central.</li>
            <li><li-head>Speed up the process</li-head>
            Since we had limited development resources, I jumped into code and <strong>hand-off a JSP template, CSS, and JS files</strong> to a development team to speed up the process.</li>
